## Purpose
This forlder here is to learn how to create a reusable view in elm.
Trying to follow the concepts from an elm package called "sortable-table"
https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-sortable-table/tree/1.0.0

## Story
Create a table that lists all train reservations.
A reservation contains:
```json
{
  "name": "Bambang Santoso",
  "station_from": "Tokyo",
  "station_to": "Niigata",
  "depart_at": "2021-02-10T13:14:00",
  "arrive_at": "2021-02-10T15:21:00"
}
```
